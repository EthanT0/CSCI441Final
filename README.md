Description:
This program features a 3-dimensional revamp of the well known 1979 Atari game, Ateroids.

Usage:
The program starts in free cam mode. Use the ASDW keys to rotate the ship
left, down, right, or up. Move forward with the SPACE key and backwards
with X. To switch to arcball mode press 2, and to switch back to free cam
press 1. While in arcball mode, the ship is stationary but can rotate using
ASDW. You can look all around by clicking and dragging and zoom in and out
by clicking and dragging while holding down CTRL. 

Compiling:
On lab machines, make sure to edit or replace CMakeList to use 
Z:/CSCI441/include and Z:/CSCI441/lib (or change paths accordingly to 
your machine)  

Bugs / Other:


NEW: A description of the file format that your program reads as input
